# Current State

Initialized for the Pólya AI collaboration.

The authoritative graph is `state/proof_obligations.yml`. The initial primary target is exact Dirichlet Pólya for 3D spherical shells. No theorem has been proved by this repository yet.

## Round 1 Update

Timestamp: 2026-07-12 19:52:28

See `rounds/polya-main/round_001/judge/judge-001.md`.

State patch validation: created: SHELL-sturm-liouville-completeness, SHELL-exact-phase-rep, SHELL-phase-monotonicity, SHELL-count-floor-identity, SHELL-angular-cutoff, SHELL-inner-turning, SHELL-fixed-rho-high-energy, SHELL-weighted-lattice-fractional, SHELL-spherical-bessel-algebraic; updated: CONV-strict-counting, TARGET-shell-d3, SHELL-cross-product-formula, SRC-bessel-phase, SRC-annuli, SRC-shell-weyl, SRC-FLPS-balls, FLPS-disk-ball-reproduction, SHELL-phase-enclosures, SHELL-lattice-count, COMP-certified-bessel, SHELL-rho-uniformity, ELLIPSE-near-circular, CERT-certificate-family; rejected: A3-proposed-blocked-statuses, toy-weighted-fractional-test, raw-floating-point-computation-as-proof, bare-two-term-weyl-proof, judge1-progress-score-7; no_change: POLYA-program-target, SRC-mathieu-ellipse, SRC-jiang-lin; round score: 3; Structural de-risking only: exact monotone phase scaffold, a proved angular cutoff, and a proved counting convention; no shell Polya theorem and both quantitative blockers, inner-turning enclosure and 2D weighted lattice control, remain open. The final synthesis adopts judge2 calibration while importing judge1 completeness and diagnostic coverage.

## Round 2 Update

Date: 2026-07-12

See `rounds/polya-main/round_002/judge/judge-002.md`.

The Bessel-phase and annulus source audits are complete. The real-order annulus phase-difference estimate transfers to half-integer shell orders, with a global one-sided bound and a correlated $+1/4$ bound when $\nu\le\rho K$. A floating-point diagnostic prototype was added and remains non-certified. The next primary target is the $2\ell+1$ weighted lattice inequality; no Pólya theorem has been proved.

### Round 2 amendment

See `rounds/polya-main/round_002/judge/judge-002-amendment.md`.

The imported global phase enclosure passed incumbent, strictly isolated clean-room, and adversarial review and is now `proved_internal`. Its absolute $1/4$ slack remains untested under the $2\ell+1$ weighted sum, particularly as $\rho\to1$. This is now the primary analytic bottleneck.

The final graph-hygiene patch is recorded in `rounds/polya-main/round_002/judge/judge-002-cleanup.md`; it removes discharged prerequisites from blocker lists without changing any mathematical status.

## Round 3 Update

Date: 2026-07-12

See `rounds/polya-main/round_003/judge/judge-003.md`.

The exact weighted proxy, Weyl integral, square formulation, and $2\ell+1$ multiplicity-to-tail reduction passed incumbent, independent clean-room, and adversarial review. Every shifted tail beginning at or above the inner interface $\rho K$ is proved by the audited FLPS convex theorem. Nicholson's formula also gives the exact phase-level zero region $(1-\rho)K\le\pi$.

The full weighted lattice obligation remains open. Its sole active analytic blocker is now the shifted-tail inequality for starts below $\rho K$, where the shell action changes from concave to convex. The floating grid found no counterexample but remains diagnostic only. No shell Pólya theorem has been proved.

### Round 3 fixed-rho continuation

See `rounds/polya-main/round_003/judge/judge-003-fixed-rho.md`.

The low-interface bottleneck is closed in the fixed-$\rho$ high-energy range for every $0<\rho<1$. The proof bounds the initial constant-floor plateau by $O_\rho(\sqrt K)$ using the shell action's quantitative curvature, then uses the sharpened concave and convex trapezoidal estimates to obtain an $O_\rho(K)$ compensating margin. This gives an explicit $K_0(\rho)$ and promotes `SHELL-weighted-lattice-fractional` to `proved_internal`.

The eigenvalue-level fixed-$\rho$ result remains `derived_under_assumptions` because `SHELL-sturm-liouville-completeness` is open. The threshold is not uniform as $\rho\to1$, and the remaining parameter region is not certified. No shell Pólya theorem has been proved.
